Hate Speech and Stereotype Detection
This project involves comparing various models for performing the HaSpeeDe (Hate Speech Detection Task) classification. The project was completed as part of a course in computational linguistics.

The HaSpeeDe 2 task was proposed by EVALITA, an initiative that promotes the development and dissemination of resources and technologies for the automatic processing of the Italian language. You can find more information about the task on the EVALITA website.
